Remarkably, moving the color flip to the end（把颜色翻转移动到底部）
in the top-down 2-3-4 tree（在自顶向下的2-3-4树中） implementation just described
yields（产生了） an implementation for 2-3 trees.

We
#1 split any 4-node（分解4-结点） that is created by doing a color flip（由于颜色翻转所产生的4-结点）,
passing a red link up the tree（把红色链接沿着树向上传递）, and
#2 dealing with the effects of doing so（处理由此而产生的影响）
in precisely the same way as we move up the tree（沿着树向上的方式）.

These ideas are also effective for simplifying
other variations of red-black trees
that have been studied,
which we cannot consider in this short abstract for lack of space.

These include handling equal keys（处理相等的键）,
completing the insertion in a single top-down pass（在单次top-down pass中完成insertion）,
and completing the insertion with at most one rotation in 2-3-4 trees（在2-3-4树中以最多一次旋转来完成插入）.
