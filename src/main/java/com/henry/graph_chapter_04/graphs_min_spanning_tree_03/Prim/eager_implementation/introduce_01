To improve the lazy implementation of Prim's algorithm,
we might try to delete ineligible edges from the priority queue,
so that the priority queue contains only the crossing edges.

But we can eliminate even more edges.

The key is to note that
our only interest is in the minimal edge
from each non-tree vertex to a tree vertex.

When we add a vertex v to the tree,
the only possible change with respect to（针对，对于） each non-tree vertex w is that
adding v brings w closer than before
to the tree.
当我们 把 顶点v 加入树中 时，
对于每个 不在树中的 顶点w 而言，唯一可能 发生的变化 是：
加入v 使得 w 比之前 更靠近这棵树了。



In short, we do not need to keep on(在计算机领域，queue的介词使用on) the priority queue
all of the edges from w to vertices tree ——
we just need to keep track of(跟踪，记录) the minimum-weight edge
and check whether
the addition of v to the tree 把节点v添加到树中
necessitates（迫使） that we update that minimum
(because of an edge v-w that has lower weight),
which we can do as we process each edge in s adjacency list.

In other words, we maintain on the priority queue
just one edge for each non-tree vertex:
the shortest edge that connects it to the tree.
换句话说，对于 每一个非树节点，我们在优先队列中，只为其保留一条边：即 把 该结点 连接到 树 的最小边。
