To improve the lazy implementation of Prim's algorithm,
we might try to delete ineligible edges from the priority queue,
so that the priority queue contains only the crossing edges.

But we can eliminate even more edges.

The key is to note that
our only interest is in the minimal edge
from each non-tree vertex to a tree vertex.

When we add a vertex v to the tree,
the only possible change with respect to each non-tree vertex w is that
adding v brings w closer than before
to the tree.

In short, we do not need to keep on the priority queue
all of the edges from w to vertices tree—

we just need to keep track of the minimum-weight edge
and check whether
the addition of v to the tree
necessitates(使成为必要) that we update that minimum
(because of an edge v-w that has lower weight),
which we can do as we process each edge in s adjacency list.

In other words, we maintain on the priority queue
just one edge for each non-tree vertex:
the shortest edge that connects it to the tree.
